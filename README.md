# cv-virtual.mouse

This is a mouse that performs drag operation via hand motions along the size of your screen and clicks based on the index finger and the thumb finger pressing against each other.

The neccessary libraries used are opencv , pyautogui and mediapip

The logic starts from understanding the landmarks in a human hand that are observed from the video capture.
